# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Using-Histopathology-Images
Breast cancer remains one of the main female cancer murderers globally. Correct and timely diagnosis is of extremely crucial importance to successful treatment and favorable prognosis. Histopathology imaging, i.e., cancer diagnosis gold standard, provides tissue morphology at high resolution needed in detecting malignancy. Yet imaging visioning takes time, can be subject to inter-observer variability, and needs skilled pathologists. This research suggests a deep learning model to classify breast cancer from histopathology images automatically. The model employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to hierarchically learn features to determine if the tissue sample is benign or malignant. The model was tested and trained using public datasets, such as the BreakHis dataset. The study is useful since it suggests the potential of AI-based histopathological diagnosis in facilitating clinical decision-making and optimizing diagnostic yield in the management of breast cancer.
